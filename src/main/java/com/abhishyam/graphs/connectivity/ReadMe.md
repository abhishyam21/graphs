<h2>Eulerian Graph</h2>
<p>A Graph is said to be Eulerian if it has a Eulrian Cycle or Circuit. 
A Graph i said to be Semi Eulerian if it has Eulerian Path</p>

<u>Eulerian Cycle/Circuit:</u>
An Un-Directed Graph is said to be Eulerian Cycle if it has
following two conditions true
<li>All Vertices with non-zero degree are connected.</li>
<li>All Vertices has even degree.</li>
<br>

<u>Eulerian Path:</u>
An Un-Directed Graph is said to be Eulerian Path If is has 
following two conditions true
<li>All Vertices with non-zero degree are connected.</li>
<li>If zero or two vertices have odd degree and rest of the
vertices have even degree.</li>
